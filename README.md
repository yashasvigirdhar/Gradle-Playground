# Gradle-Playground

I find Gradle very interesting, and the fact that there are not much blogs online makes it even more. So I've created this repository to just play around gradle. 

Features covered till now:

- Defining new `Task` classes ( in `Kotlin` :) )
- Defining new `tasks and dependencies` between them
- Writing a new `Plugin` which consumes these custom task classes
- Extracting a common functionality into a separate file and consuming it.
- Using `GrGit`
- Reading and writing `File`
- Consuming `Logger`
