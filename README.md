# Gradle-Playground

I find Gradle very interesting, and the fact that there are not much blogs online makes it even more. So I've created this repository to just play around gradle. 

Features covered till now:

- Defining new Task classes ( in kotlin :) )
- Defining new tasks and dependencies between them
- Writing a new plugin which consumes these custom task classes
- Extracting a common functionality into a separate file and consuming it.
- Using GrGit
- Reading and writing file
- Consuming logger
